# Time_Series_Analysis
Time series analysis involves analyzing and modeling data that is indexed in time order. In this context, the Zillow dataset represents a time series, where housing prices are recorded at successive equally spaced points in time. Time series analysis allows us to understand patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data, ultimately enabling us to make predictions about future values.

# Zillow Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices using the Zillow Economic Dataset, which contains 20 years of housing price data from 1996 to 2017. Leveraging time series analysis techniques, we aim to forecast future housing prices based on historical trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the Zillow dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and any other data inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations between variables.
3. **Time Series Modeling**: Build and train time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), or Prophet, using historical housing price data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. **Future Price Prediction**: Use the trained models to forecast future housing prices beyond the available dataset.
